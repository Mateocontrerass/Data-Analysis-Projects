# Exploring the Impact of Handwashing on Childbed Fever Mortality

This Jupyter Notebook analyzes data related to Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis' discovery of the link between handwashing and reduced childbed fever mortality rates in the 19th century.

**Project Overview:**

This project investigates the dramatic decrease in deaths following the implementation of mandatory handwashing protocols at Vienna General Hospital.

**Running the Notebook:**

1. Install required libraries (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib) using `pip install pandas matplotlib`
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or a similar environment.
3. Run the code cells sequentially for analysis and visualization.

**Key Findings:**

* The analysis demonstrates a significant drop in childbed fever mortality after handwashing practices were introduced.
* The notebook highlights the historical context and challenges Semmelweis faced in gaining acceptance for his discovery.
